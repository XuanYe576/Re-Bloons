# Re-Bloons
Small project, I was bore in class and I ask my friend O1(private name, protected) what should I do? He said try make bloons td...
I be like okay, I first took use of unity and made UI in like 40 minutes.

I just wanted to code or should I say typing... well, ofcourse I encounter a lot of bugs.
